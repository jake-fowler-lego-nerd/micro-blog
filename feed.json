I spent the day pissed off and miserable. I made those around me miserable; that was mainly my wife - I was getting on her nerves by mid-day. My somewhat conscious logic was to deal with the emotions all at once, get it out of my system and begin the process of moving on. They had been a lingering undercurrent for the past several weeks and I was tired of feeling them. I walked around the house all day saying F this, F them, F that, I even cussed out my dogs if they looked at me funny, which they often do.

I’m les stressed, happier than I’ve been in ages, and full of hope for the future. I had become so used to carrying that stress and those negative emotions without dealing with it that it had become almost toxic. The ironic thing is, I posted a new profile picture on my socials and I had a big old smile on my face. I took that photo on the angry day - I must have unconsciously known that I was on the right path.

We're going to see [Iron and Wine](https://ironandwine.com) in a couple of weeks at the [Uptown Theater](http://uptowntheater.com).  {{< apple-music url=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/light-verse/1726083469\" >}} Then, two days later, We're going to see[ My Morning Jacket ](https://www.mymorningjacket.com)at the same venue. I love the Uptown, it's a relatively small, brightly painted old theater, we've seen hundred of shows there over the years. My Morning Jacket's latest album, Is, is fantastic {{< apple-music url=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/is/1786273438\" >}}\n\nI'm also going to the [Record Bar](https://www.therecordbar.com) in May to see another favorite [Messer Chups](https://messerchupsofficial.bandcamp.com). {{< apple-music url=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/dark-side-of-paradise/1739156722\">}}\nMesser Chups is a Russian Surf Punk band who do a lot of fun covers along with originals. They are a blast to see live! \n\nSmall update: I forgot to mention the Nick Cave show I’m going to in May. I’ve seen him once before, he’s a fantastic musician with heartfelt lyrics. His latest Album, *Wild God*, is excellent. {{< apple-music url=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/wild-god/1733028849\" >}} He’s written a couple of great, though dark books and he has a newsletter, [The Red Hand Files](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/about/) that’s worth subscribing to.

I’m fairly certainly a scene in this movie is the source of my aversion to cockroaches. I distinctly remember someone getting eated alive in an old car by giant cockroaches.

This is his Bio from Blue Rain Gallery&rsquo;s website:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ryansingerart/\">Ryan Singer</a> is a Diné (Navajo) artist and painter based in Albuquerque, NM, known for his unique blend of traditional Navajo heritage and science fiction artistry. His work weaves together childhood memories with nostalgic pop culture elements, including science fiction imagery. With a strong presence in the &ldquo;Indigenous Futurism&rdquo; movement, Ryan’s artwork often features characters from Star Wars, a passion he&rsquo;s had since 1977. He also creates contemporary, realistic portraits of Native subjects, capturing their essence with a modern appeal. Ryan&rsquo;s work has earned numerous awards, including recognition from the prestigious SWAIA’s Santa Fe Indian Market, and is held in collections of museums and private collectors worldwide. Currently working towards his BFA at the University of New Mexico, Ryan continues to expand his artistic practice, collaborating with the Tamarind Institute and working towards his MFA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We loved the whimsical yet serious nature and style of his work and the combination of imagery from his Navajo culture and SciFi/pop culture. There were several pieces that we were tempted by but we decided to wait and think about it. The folks at the gallery told us we could email them and they would ship anything we like and also mentioned that they were hosting an opening for Ryan in a couple of hours, if we wanted to meet the artist. We walked around the Railyard, ended up going to the <a href=\"https://www.nuckollsbrewing.com\">Nuckolls Brewery</a> for a couple of beers and decided to go back to the gallery for the opening. It was great to meet Ryan and chat with him about his work, which makes purchasing art even more special.</p>\n<p>The piece we ended up purchasing is titled: &ldquo;A Brief Moment of the Carbon Cycle”. It&rsquo;s a 16” X 20”, acrylic on canvas painting done in 2024. there were some really fun Star Wars themed pieces, and a cowboy ET drinking beer, but this one stuck with us as we walked around thinking about the show. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ryansingerart/\">You can check out his other work on his instagram page</a>!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’ve been trying to see one of our favorite bands, <a href=\"https://www.chairkickers.com\">Low</a>, who were touring for their latest album, \"Hey What,” until very recently. Maura bought me tickets to see them in Davenport, Iowa, for my birthday. We drove up, excited to finally hear some tracks off their latest album live, and the show was canceled due to COVID-19. We had a fun time in Davenport anyway, but it was a <a href=\"https://www.jakefowler.com/category/blog/\">huge bummer</a>. The show was rescheduled, and we planned to return to Davenport; we even booked the hotel, and we both came down with COVID. We found out they were finally going to come to Kansas City, opening for Death Cab for Cutie (weird match-up, in my opinion, but whatever). We bought tickets, but that show was postponed, and Low was no longer going to open. It seemed like we just weren’t meant to see them again! We did see them once several years ago at the old Record Bar when it was in Westport (we could walk home from there!) But the latest album was simply stunning; I still get chills and tear up when I listen to it. And I can’t help but turn it up a little too loud.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Alan Sparhawk’s and Mimi Parker’s harmonies over the cacophonous instrumentation and drums were, well, kind of beyond words. I really can’t do the albums justice here. It may not be for everyone, but I LOVED where they were going. Don’t get me wrong, they were (were! 😔) prolific; they didn’t create an album I didn’t like. You definitely have to be in the right mood for some of their early stuff, it can be very slow-paced, but it’s just as beautiful. The latest albums were getting a little more gritty and experimental, which contrasted wonderfully with their voices. Go ahead, listen and listen loud. I bet you will be moved. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sadly, we will never have the chance to see them perform live again; Mimi Parker died today after having fought ovarian cancer for the last couple of years. Alan posted the news and was instantly heartbroken. Partly because we’ve been trying so hard to see them over the last year or so, but primarily for her and Alan. I can’t even imagine what they went through and what he’s going through now. They worked so well together. Their music is beautiful, incomparable; there will be nothing like it in the world again. I love listening to their records via streaming, but live music was the true experience. That’s true for most musicians, but it was especially true for them. Farewell, Mimi Parker, and deepest condolences to you, Alan Sparhawk. Know that your fans are there for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"[www.youtube.com/embed/uLY...](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLYmrHBzMqI)\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"embed-handler\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n[www.youtube.com/embed/uLY...](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLYmrHBzMqI)\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n",

It took about six hours with stops, not bad, but enough to mess with our backs. I like roadtrips with Maura, we talked and listened to some new tunes on the way up - the new <a href=\"https://jackwhiteiii.com\">Jack White</a> is pretty good! Once we got to town, we settled into our hotel, then walked around to check out the downtown area. The venue - the <a href=\"https://www.theraccoonmotel.com\">Racoon Motel</a>, was right down the street from where we were staying. Next door to it, we found a record shop, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/raggedrecords/\">Ragged Records</a>, where we found a nice little haul.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1878,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://jakefowler.micro.blog/uploads/2025/a7c47e0172.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1878\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We grabbed some dinner at the <a href=\"https://www.frontstreetbrew.com\">Front Street Brewery</a>, and I checked the Racoon Motel’s Facebook page while we were waiting on our food. The show had been canceled due to a couple of positive COVID tests. We were seriouly bummed. I’ve been imagining hearing Low’s latest music live for months and we were just hours away from doing so. The show was rescheduled for another Friday in July, which we will make work. We figured we were here so we might as well make a night of it, so we asked our waitress about other spots to check out nearby. She did not dissapoint; there are some pretty great bars in downtown Davenport. First, we figured we should check out the venue since we had come all this way, so we grabbed a beer there, commiserated with the staff, and checked out the stage - it’s a small area; it’s going to be very loud (in July)! After that, we went to a bar with a perfect name: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/devonscomplaintdept\">Devon’s Complaint Dept.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1879,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://jakefowler.micro.blog/uploads/2025/d64a5bb361.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1879\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They mixed some great drinks, and the bar had a cool retro vibe. We’ve been trying to get out more lately, but I can’t remember the last time we went bar hopping! It’s kind of a shame that we had to drive all the way to Davenport, but the drinks were tasty and way cheaper!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, back at the hotel, we discovered that it was hosting a youth dance competition. There were many families with young girls in way too much makeup and glittery outfits. I’m sure they were having the time of their lives, but we didn’t particularly enjoy the noise levels. The hotel has a central atrium around the rooms; they were very loud and echoey. They were running around until pretty late, which was so much fun for us after a night on the town! We ended up playing Low’s latest album in our hotel room mostly to drown out the noise. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The next morning, I woke up early, as I always do, and walked along the Mississippi. It was a nice walk, though it made me wish that KC had more down by our river front. I never knew that Pelicans like to visit the river this time of year, but I saw several of them! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1883,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\",\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img src=\"https://jakefowler.micro.blog/uploads/2025/f74804f05b.jpg\" alt=\"Pelicans on the Mississippi\" class=\"wp-image-1883\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While it was a huge bummer to have the show rescheduled, it was good to get out of town for a bit.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Last night Maura and I attended a reading, signing, and conversation hosted by the wonderful<!-- raw HTML omitted -->National Museum of Toys and Miniatures<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Seriously, if you are anywhere near KC and haven&rsquo;t been, you MUST go. Authors Bill Shapiro (the former editor-in-chief and founding editor of Getty Images FOTO) and Naomi Wax (whose work has appeared in the New York Times, LA Times, and the Iowa Review) were at the museum to present their latest book called &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->WHAT WE KEEP, 150 People Share the One Object That Brings Them Joy, Magic, and Meaning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;. Bill and Naomi interviewed people from all over the country, from all walks of life, asking them about an object that has deep meaning and then publishes images of the objects along with the stories, in the person&rsquo;s own word. At the event, they did a reading of some of their favorite objects and stories, then did a Q&amp;A answering some great questions from the attendees about their process, how they chose who to talk to, etc. They started by talking to people they knew, then took an exponential approach, talking to people that they people they knew knew. They then decided to travel across the country, seeking out people that they decided might be interesting to talk to. During their travels, they came to Kansas City, heard about the Toy and Miniature Museum and decided they had to stop in to check it out - only for half an hour or so. Unsurprisingly they ended up spending four hours there, missing an interview in Iowa.</p>\n<p>After the reading and Q&amp;A session, they did a book signing - before the reading, they were making their way around the room to introduce themselves to everyone. It was so great to meet them and have a brief conversation with them before the talk and at the signing - this project is obviously very meaningful to them. So meaningful in fact, that the last segment of the evening was a group conversation where the attendees broke into two groups to discuss their most treasured objects.

Seriously, if you are anywhere near KC and haven't been, you MUST go. Authors Bill Shapiro (the former editor-in-chief and founding editor of Getty Images FOTO) and Naomi Wax (whose work has appeared in the New York Times, LA Times, and the Iowa Review) were at the museum to present their latest book called \"<a href=\"https://www.runningpress.com/titles/bill-shapiro/what-we-keep/9780762462551/\">WHAT WE KEEP, 150 People Share the One Object That Brings Them Joy, Magic, and Meaning</a>\". Bill and Naomi interviewed people from all over the country, from all walks of life, asking them about an object that has deep meaning and then publishes images of the objects along with the stories, in the person's own word. At the event, they did a reading of some of their favorite objects and stories, then did a Q&amp;A answering some great questions from the attendees about their process, how they chose who to talk to, etc. They started by talking to people they knew, then took an exponential approach, talking to people that they people they knew knew. They then decided to travel across the country, seeking out people that they decided might be interesting to talk to. During their travels, they came to Kansas City, heard about the Toy and Miniature Museum and decided they had to stop in to check it out - only for half an hour or so. Unsurprisingly they ended up spending four hours there, missing an interview in Iowa.\n\nAfter the reading and Q&amp;A session, they did a book signing - before the reading, they were making their way around the room to introduce themselves to everyone. It was so great to meet them and have a brief conversation with them before the talk and at the signing - this project is obviously very meaningful to them. So meaningful in fact, that the last segment of the evening was a group conversation where the attendees broke into two groups to discuss their most treasured objects. During the break, Maura and I were naturally thinking about and discussing what objects we would have selected. Bill led the conversation at our table. He gave us a few minutes to draw the object on one side of a card, then flip it over and answer several questions about the object and why we chose it.

				"content_text": "I just met with the neurologist. I passed all of her neuro-tests with flying colors, which means there is no new reason for the headaches. They are simply a result of my brain dealing with the embolization. As she put it \"Your brain is mad at you.\" She prescribed some painkillers for when it's really bad and something else that should help with the pain long term. We'll spend a week or two figuring out the proper dosage of the new drug. \n\nI am, of course having another bad headache now after going to the doctor and then the pharmacy.

I now have a hole in my upper leg/groin area that hurt like a @#%(!.</p>\n<p>The day was very long. Originally we were supposed to be there at 11:00 to sign in and prep for a 12:00 procedure. It got bumped back several hours due to an emergency. The scheduling nurse came out to talk to us and offered to let us walk around and she&rsquo;d call when it was close to time for us to come back. We live five minutes from the hospital, so we just went home for a little over an hour. I watched an episode of Dr. Who and caught up on some email.</p>\n<p>We got the call and went back to wait some more and then finally went to the prep room where I changed into one of the wonderful backless robes and got all plugged in. We waited some more for the room to become available and then I was finally being wheeled into the operating room. I met some very nice folks who explained everything clearly and even gave me a nice bikini line! She told me a story about an 80 year old gentleman who she had prepped a while ago. He was obviously very nervous and uncomfortable and while she was shaving him, he asked why they had to do both sides. She replied that they might have to switch entry points and besides his wife had entered him into a bikini contest! He laughed and was much more talkative and comfortable after that.</p>\n<p>The procedure itself was weird. I was awake with very mild sedation because they wanted to have activity going on in my brain (yeah, I know what your&rsquo;e thinking now&hellip;) They ran a very small tube up into my neck where they would inject dye that would make it&rsquo;s way into my brain as they were shooting x-rays. Every time they injected the dye, I had to be completely still, with my eyes closed; no breathing, no swallowing, no moving. My neurosurgeon was the one running the procedure and he would repeat that, mantra-like every time. It was almost hypnotic. The dye made my face feel like it was on fire. I could feel it in the back of my throat and at the bottom of my ears but it spread to my cheeks and nose a little. It was kind of like a wasabi rush, very uncomfortable for a few almost unbearable seconds then gone. During a couple of the shots I could see what looked like a million shooting stars. He also said they might make me feel dizzy, but that was not terribly accurate; it was more like the entire world twisted in incomprehensible ways and I was at the center of it.</p>\n<p>After the procedure, I had to lie flat for two hours to make sure there was no bleeding or excessing swelling. Never in my life have I had so many different people check my groin so many times. We came home around 7:45 and ordered a pizza. I hadn&rsquo;t eaten anything in twenty-four hours at that point; I was so hungry! I&rsquo;m very glad I took a couple of days off from work, I&rsquo;m feeling okay, but it&rsquo;s very sore and I&rsquo;m supposed to be off my feet as much as possible. Walking around is okay, but bending over kills.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll meet with the neurosurgeon next Wednesday to go over the findings and figure out what&rsquo;s next.

I guess it's a combination of <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jakefowler\">Twitter</a>, free time, and Winter blahs.  Strangely enough, now that I'm starting to get motivated again, I'm also about to get really busy with the web dev thing.  I have two bids due by the end of the week, one site about to ramp up to the final stages, and another site coming up very soon.  Not to mention updates to current sites getting our OWN site up and running.  I'm excited, honored, and nervous about all of this.  I still can't believe I actually get paid to do this stuff, it started out as a hobby.</p>\n\n<p>In other news, I've finally joined the exciting world of scooters.  I bought a 2002 <a href=\"http://www.genuinescooters.com/scooters/stella/stella.html\">Genuine</a> Stella.  Here she is:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"> <img src=\"http://www.jakefowler.com/pictures/stella.jpg\" alt=\"Stella!\" title=\"Stella!\">\n</div>\n\n<p>I also bought a bright orange helmet:</p>\n<div align=\"center\"> <img src=\"http://www.jakefowler.com/pictures/helmet.jpg\" alt=\"Stella!\" title=\"Stella!\">\n</div>\n\n<p>I've been wanting one for a while.  I don't work far from home and it seems a little wasteful to drive a car every day.  Beside, it's a blast!  I'm having a hard time parking it when I get to work, I just want to keep riding!  The second day I had it I rode it out to my mom's in Prairie Village, down State Line.  I guess I took to it like a fish IN water - I can't believe I waited this long to get one!  The Stella is based on the older style of scooters, all metal - very solid with a manual transmission and a 150cc engine.  She'll get up to 70mph or so.</p>\n",

There's actually only been one year in my entire life that I actually followed through with all of my resolutions.  My friend and I set some very specific, achievable goals and held each other accountable for them.  At first I wasn't even going to bother with any, I usually don't, but as I thought about what I would want to achieve this year, I managed to come up with a few that I could deal with.  So here they are, in no particulat order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Develop a thicker skin - I resolve not to let people get to me and make my life miserable, even (especially) the stupid people.</li>\n\n<li>100 pushups - My wife and I have tried <a href=\"http://hundredpushups.com/\" target=\"_blank\">this program</a> a couple of times, but some thing kills our momentum and we stop.  Not this time, this time I resolve to trudge through the arms feeling like jelly phase and eventually reach 100.</li> \n\n<li>Second tattoo - I already have the designs of the next two chosen, I just have to get someone to draw the third one.  I resolve to finally get my second tattoo.</li>\n\n</ol>\n<p>That's it for now.  They're nothing big, but they are very specific and definitely achievable.</p>\n",
